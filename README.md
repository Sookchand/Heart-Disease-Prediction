## ðŸš€ About Me
I have experience as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. I have worked on
projects involving the development of predictive models, the optimization of machine
learning algorithms, and the deployment of machine learning models. I have also worked on
projects involving the analysis of large datasets, the development of data-driven insights,
and the creation of data visualizations.
